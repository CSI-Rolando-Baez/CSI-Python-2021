# | This code looks to calculate how far a "BS" bullet shot from an SV-98 while on-top of the Willis Tower travels. The projectile speed
# | of the bullet is 785 m/s while the height of the building is 526.99m. To find the distance the bullet travels we need to find time
# | it travels the formula needed to use to find this is (((2*height)/gravity) ** 0.5) after finding the time it travels for we can 
# | find the distance by using this formula (speed*time).
